# Synth 📼

Synth is a decentralized, community-oriented yield farmer. Users can deposit tokens into the Synth Vault smart contract which will be used to contribute to the Synth community funds. The community, made up of the depositors, will regularly decide on the best yield farms to stake the Synth community funds. User voting power will be proportional to the amount of funds the user has deposited to the Synth community funds. The interest earned from the yield farms will be distributed into the users' account balance. Users will be able to withdraw tokens from their vault accounts at anytime. 

## Synth Vault 🏦

The Synth Vault smart contract is where users can deposit to, withdraw from, and view their account balance. There will be a specific list of tokens that are allowed to be deposited into the vault that will be determined by the farms Synth is able to interact with at the moment. 

### Interest and Airdrops 📦

Interest will be regularly distributed to all of the account balances in the Synth Vault. The amount of interest distributed into a specific account will be determined by the amount of tokens held in the vault for the complete interest period and the type of account the user has. Along with all interest distributions, users will also be airdropped Synth tokens, which represent voting power on all community farming decisions. 

### Account types 

There will be two types of accounts on the Synth Vault. 

## Community farming 🚜

The community of Synth users will be able to propose and vote on which yield farms to create positions on with the community fund.
